The Python programming language
-------------------------------

Python is a powerful programming language that allows simple and flexible representations of networks, and  clear and concise expressions of network algorithms (and other algorithms too).  Python has a vibrant and growing ecosystem of packages that NetworkX uses to provide more features such as numerical linear algebra and drawing.  In addition 
Python is also an excellent "glue" language for putting together pieces of software from other languages which allows reuse of legacy code and engineering of high-performance algorithms [Langtangen04]_. 

Equally important, Python is free, well-supported, and a joy to use. 

In order to make the most out of NetworkX you will want to know how to write basic programs in Python.  
Among the many guides to Python, we recommend the documentation at
http://www.python.org and the text by Alex Martelli [Martelli03]_.
